# 7.6V-4A-DC-DC-Buck-Converter
The converter is designed to step down an 8 V â€“ 36 V DC input to a regulated 7.6 V output, capable of supplying up to 4 A continuous load current. The LMR51450 integrates both high-side and low-side MOSFETs, reducing external component count and ensuring a compact, robust power stage.
